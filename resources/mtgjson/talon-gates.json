  "text": "Any time you could cast a sorcery, you may exile a nonland card from your hand with X time counters on it, where X is its converted mana cost. If the exiled card doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. (At the beginning of its owner's upkeep, he or she removes a time counter. When the last is removed, the player casts it without paying its mana cost. If it's a creature, it has haste.)\nWhenever you roll CHAOS, remove two time counters from each suspended card you own.",
